# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Most nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) modeling is focused entirely on the isotropic nuclear shielding. The NMR measurement, however, probes a tensor property and significant stuctural information is lost if we only look at the isotropic portion of this tensor. Unfortunately, modeling a tensor is not straightforward, as tensor symmetries must be taken into account when building the model, and this has been impossible up until now. In this work we introduce a graph neural network (GNN) that is capable of predicting NMR tensors. We further benchmark this model and take a deep dive into the best practices for designing and assessing tensor based models.

My main contributions to this work are: (1) curation and processing of data set, (2) building, training, and assessments of all models, (3) developing tensor evaluation frameworks and comparisons to existing frameworks.
