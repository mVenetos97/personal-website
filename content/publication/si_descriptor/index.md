# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In 2007 measuring the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) tensor in highly symmetric silica materials became possible. In that original study, stuctural relationships between silicon geometry and the tensor anisotropy were explored but nothing was found. The authors at the time deemed the structure-anisotropy relationship impossible (or at least extremely difficult) to model analytically. Modeling something such as the anisotropy helps a great deal during structure elucidation studies as it is an additional piece of information we can use to determine the structure, and is thus something we are interested in modeling. Through a combination of theory-based feature engineering and using machine learning techniques like symbolic regression and feature importance analysis, we have developed an interpretable analytical model for the relationship between silicon geometry and anisotropy.

My main contributions to this work are (1) curation and processing of data set, (2) developing the features used in the feature engineering phase, (3) using a combination of random forests and symbolic regression to determine a functional form for a descriptor of silicon anisotropy.
